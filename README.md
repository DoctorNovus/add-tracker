# ADHD Tracker
Welcome to my ADHD Tracker. This project is built by [Daniel Wedding (@DoctorNovus)](https://github.com/DoctorNovus). It's biggest intention is to help me take one of my biggest struggles, ADHD, and give me ways to manage it. If you like what you see, please give it a star, and use it if you think you can.
